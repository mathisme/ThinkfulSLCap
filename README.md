# Supervised Learning Capstone: Predict loan repayment
My repository for Thinkful's Data Science Flex program's capstone 2 on supervised learning

For this capstone project we were to go out and find a dataset of interest, explore the data, and model an outcome of interest.

For this project I chose the Loan Data dataset on Kaggle, (https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data)[https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data]
My interest in this dataset was the opportunity to takle imbalanced data.  We did not go into detail on how to hand imbalanced data in the bootcamp so I needed to research thhis on my own.


# Included in the repository 

* (Capstone.ipynb)[Capstone.ipynb] -- the main notebook
* (Capstone2.pptx)[Capstone2.pptx] -- the PowerPoint presentation

# Tools used

# Tasks for the future
* Utilize Imbalanced-Learn SMOTE oversampling.  In my project I utilized random undersampling and random oversampling but at the suggestion of the grader of my presentation I should use SMOTE
* Restructure the PowerPoint.  My PowerPoint presentation did not have a proper structure according to the data scientist from Thinkful I was presenting to.  He was very generous to give an outline of a proper structure.  In the future I would like to restructure my PowerPoint
* Utilize other supervised learning algorithms.  I started notebooks to use SGBoost, SVM, and decision trees but did not complete them.
